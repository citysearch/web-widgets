      <h2>Message from Geisha House</h2>
      <p><p>GEISHA HOUSE is a modern Japanese Restaurant, Sushi Bar and Sake Lounge that embraces the flavor of traditional Japan while catering to the hip, sophisticated clientele of Los Angeles.
Taking a cue from Japans popular sake bars and traditional Geisha Houses of entertainment, GEISHA HOUSE serves Japanese cuisine as well as fresh sushi and sashimi dishes with contemporary spin. Whether its a wrap party or a simple dinner for two, GEISHA HOUSE is a destination point for groups of all sizes.</p></p>
      <p></p>


      <h2>Editorial from Citysearch</h2>
      The glowing pink squares on the building's exterior set the scene for the "Paris was here so I should be too" crowd at this Dolce Group standby. The mostly 20-something crowd enters through a red-painted wood hallway, arriving at a full-length mirror--a not-so-subtle hint at the see-and-be-seen posing to come. Inside, the prominent main bar's white-grid-enclosed plasma screens are a focal point from every vantage point. Further back, a three-tiered fireplace anchors the main dining room, which is lined with kimono-like swatches and a twig-enclosed private booth. The less showy second floor caters to earlier-arriving diners. Sharable portions of Pan-Asian dishes include Mongolian lamb chops while sushi options run the gamut from maguro on crispy rice cake to tempura lobster hand rolls wrapped in delicate soy paper.

    <p class="description">Aside from the fantastic 'aura' of the place (blood red building on Hollywood Blvd), it has very great sushi. Their spins on traditional takes makes for a refreshing experience. Great for a gals night out. The main dining area is open air, so bring a sweater.</p>

    <p class="review_text description">From NY and came to Geisha House for a speed dating event at Speed LA Dating. I had never been to Geisha House before and really enjoyed myself. Thought the ambiance was chill, drinks were great and loved the patio we were on. The event had food but I didn't get a chance to try any of it. Would absolutely go back for dinner. I can't tell you how surprised I was to see negative reviews for this place. This must be hollywood competition angry that their still so popular. Who knows. I liked it. </p>

    <p class="review_text description">I have been going to Geisha since it first opened about 5 years ago.  It used to be a great scene with really good Japanse food and sushi. It wasn't cheap but was not too expensive for the scene and the food.  We had many fun nights out at Geisha. Well, I went there Saturday some friends. Now the "scene" is barley there. You can get a table easily any night any time. So now it's about the food. Well,the menu prices have gone up. Every tiny Item is $10-14. We got lots of items including sushi rolls. Sadly the food is below average a couple things were actually bad! all in all we just felt ripped off and wished we went someplace else.  That will be our last time. </p>
    <p class="smFnt review_pros">Pros: Great location, cool decor,DJ</p>
    <p class="smFnt review_cons">Cons: Over priced, food is not good,</p>

    <p class="review_text description">For tourists who want to experience a real life episode of Entourage or the Hills, then this is their place. The customers are all trying hard to be "it" kids or well off 40 something year old men trying to reenact their youthful days. It's overpriced and the quality of food is garbage. The place is soooo dark, you can barely see what you're eating (which in their case might be a benefit). The servers were all wannabe actors/models and were too busy looking at themselves in the mirrored hallway entrance to serve us.</p>

    <p class="review_text description">I came here for a friends birthday last month. The sushi was pretty good but not really what I expected. I really liked the decorations and red lighting. The atmosphere was cool and it was really crowded. It seems like the place is more about the aesthetics than the quality of the food. I saw waitresses walking around with plates of food that was visually pleasing. For example, there was an Igloo shaped thing made of ice with different kinds of sushi under it. For the price, I wouldnt recommend going here but if money is not an issue than it is very fun.</p>

    <p class="review_text description">First, I was sat at a table that was covered in lettuce and crumbs from the person who ate there before me.  They had a special Valentine's Day menu that was awful and overpriced.  My miso soup was cold, my entree took 2 hours and 15 minutes to arrive at the table, the dessert was not fresh at all.  It was the worst Valentine's dinner I have ever had.  However, the server was very nice and apologetic.</p>

    <p class="review_text description">On 10/12/08 8:00pm I was greeted by a rude person whom I'll call a glorified receptionist. I asked where the bathroom was and was told over there. Apparently it was too much to ask for since I wasn't pointed in any direction . When I did find the bathroom no thanks to the staff the smell in the hallway was unacceptable. The bathroom itself was not clean and also had an odor you should never smell in a restaurant in addition there was no bathroom attendant. Our waiter was practically a no show throughout my sister birthday dinner. In addition we waited 20 minutes after eating to receive our check which never came. I literally had to walk over to the waitstaff area and ask to receive our check. By that time all tables had been removed and we were the only table of guest still their as they converted the area into a dance floor. At these prices I expect excellent service. Not snotty waiters and receptionist . Customer service should be first, period! </p>

    <p class="review_text description">Tried this supposedly notorious restaurant out for the first time.As I don't really like sushi that much,I was highly recommended the Kobe  steak by the waiter.He was okay and friendly. It was hard to see what you were eating as it is kepy pretty dark for the vibe.I had to pull pieces of fat out of my mouth from this $ 45 steak..Not impressed.My girl friend eats sushi at least twice a week & We  both are hard core diners.She does have a tendancy to complain like my mother,and I let her know sometimes.This time,the sushi smelt fishy.Well,what do I know.She still convinced me to try her sushi roll,which I just remember was the most expensive on the menu.Any way after only 2 beers and the food,We dropped  $ 180 . Wouldn't have really been a big deal except,the next morning before I went to work,I had my head in the toilet throwing my guts up.Not Good. I wasn't able to speak to my girlfriend until mid afternoon and She had also been sicker than a dog.I guess it's true what they say about fishy sushi being bad sushi.I was going to let the restaurant know,but really if they weren't that concerned to check the freshness of their fish,then why would they be concerned with their customers.I will not be back their this lifetime.In fact I think I will give sushi a miss for another decade.</p>

Went again a few Saturdays ago, and this time realized why this place doesn't always get the best reviews. (Also just went to Katsuya hollywood and can't resist to compare).I already knew it had to do with the food, so lets start there. Order what the waiter recommends, they always seem to know best, or take my recommendations. Order: spicy tuna crispy rice, albacore carpaccio, kobe, lamb, red samurai, surf and turf, all the sushi wraps. This last visit we ventured out to try new things but weren't so pleased. Now, compared with Katsuya, the food is about equal in taste, except dessert is a different story. Molten lava cake, molten lava cake!! Also the fried bananas and fruit wontons. Worth every calorie. Next problem people seem to have is the service. I have to say it just depends on the luck of the draw. Most times we have had great and sometimes really fun service, but this time not so much. I understand that usually when a restaurant gets busy the service might go down a bit but I don't appreciate rushed service where I feel like I'm annoying the waitress. This time it wasn't even that busy, how rude!! I did hear that the restaurant is under new management, so maybe they don't understand that you shouldn't just hire a waitress because she's pretty. However i won't let 1 bad waitress ruin all my experiences at Geisha. My husband made a good point, to request a server, if they allow you to do that. Ryan, Alicia, Tiffany, Alan, are amazing. Don't remember the others by name, but we've had a few more and they were really good as well. Next on the list where you sit, and it was our first time at the upstairs bar, and we hated it. People smoking, dirty tables (yuck). Last to compare, drinks. Great sake list, and a variety of delicious martini drinks, Try the geisha cosmo, kiss, or minori. Also good drinks at Katsuya but the bartenders serving them.....not as friendly or as good looking.</p>
    <p class="smFnt review_pros">Pros: Service most the time, Food, and DRINKS.</p>

    <p class="review_text description">I went with a group of friends last Saturday night...The place was packed, and with good looking people.  I have never been to a restaurant that had more large parties of good looking women; groups of six and eight of them celebrating bachelorette and birthday parties.  The vibe was fun and upbeat.  The DJ was spinning a great mix of 80's 90's classics with a dance beat.  The food is great for groups, served family style so I got to try a bunch of different dishes.  The Taru Taru is amazing.  Our server was very helpful in suggesting dishes for us to try; she actually brought us a free round of shots.  I will return and suggest it to my friends.</p>
    <p class="smFnt review_pros">Pros: Great atmosphere</p>

    <p class="review_text description">The focus at Geisha House isn't on cuisine, it's on making money by overcharging for mediocre food. I've had better food at a strip club buffet.</p>

<p class="review_text description">I only came here for a business dinner and thankfully the company picked up the tab or else I would of been really upset. I ordered the Kobe beef which tasted about on par with fajita strips. The sushi seemed like it was made the day before and sat around until I ordered it, and judging by how fast it got to my table, I'd say that's pretty accurate. The service was equally as mediocre. Drinks were weak as well.</p>

<p class="review_text description">I'd say Geisha House is the kind of place where you go to be seen and in that respect it pulls it off well. But it fails on every level of what a fine dining experience should be, clouded by it's own ego. Save your money.</p>
    <p class="smFnt review_pros">Pros: It's hard to find a pro here. I did see Lamar Odom, though.</p>
    <p class="smFnt review_cons">Cons: Mediocre food, mediocre service, overpriced and over hyped.</p>

    <p class="review_text description">This is a great place for creative sushi rolls.  The atmosphere and decor are unique and add a great vibe to the restaurant.  The tables are spread out so that each party can enjoy their meals privately, which is definitely a plus considering many other restaurants pack you in.  Sushi is overall good, but can be pricey.  I tried some sort of chicken appetizer there once and it was not good.  I'd stick with the sushi and tempura here.  Also, both times I've been here I've had great waiters who were very attentive and made the experience that much more enjoyable.  </p>

Our server's name was Tiffany and she was fantastic! She remembered my friend who had dined their almost six months ago and what he ordered!!! Since I brought two guests who had not eaten here before she suggested we have the chef bring out what he recommended! EVERYTHING was amazing! We ordered a couple of nice bottles of sake and the presentation was fantastic. The bill was half of what I thought it would be and everyone I brought loved the place! (Thank goodness since I pushed to come here) I should mention we had reservations, so I would suggest having reservations as I understand it gets rather busy for dinner. Also, my favorite dishes were the miso soup with crab, the (I think they were grilled?) peppers, the steak and the albacore. Although everything we ate was delicious! </p>

    <p class="review_text description">I live in Hollywood, so this restaurant is in my backyard. The food is very good. Obviously, they must employ japanese cooks, not koreans like most sushi places do. Of course, this quality means dinner is expensive (think at least twice what you would pay at, say, kabuki). The service, however, can range from mediocre to lousy. Last time me and my wife went, they added lots of stuff to our bill we never ordered. And the food we never ordere kept coming to our table. Some of the waitress are ding bats. Yes, good looking but 20 year old ding bats. If you go don't drink too much so you can look at your bill with clear eyes!!!</p>

    <p class="review_text description">This place is awesome.  My friends and i dined at Geisha around 5pm, its the best time to go because its not too busy and your already sat when the crowd starts pouring in. The service was cool and friendly, sushi is fresh, and perfect. You have to make a reservation or you will be waiting for hours! Also if you wanna see stars go early!  Bai Ling and some reality star came in at the same time we did. Its a must if your in the LA area.</p>

    <p class="review_text description">To be blunt, I will NEVER go to this overrated, wanna-be's trying to be seen, poor service, mediocre but over-priced sushi place again. We were seated at the sushi bar and we waited for more than 10 minutes without so much as a hello from our server. We actually got up and went to the Host station to ask someone if we could order a cocktail. We tried to order edamame from the sushi chef but he never placed the order. It was another 15 minutes before our waiter appeared to take our food order, all the while we still had NO water. We were so hungry at this point, we considered drinking the soy sauce. </p>

<p class="review_text description">When the food did start to arrive, it came in such a rushed manner that we didn't have enough room for the plates. That's okay, though, because their solution to this was to briskly take away our dishes, although they still had food on them that we were trying to eat. </p>

<p class="review_text description">We ordered Rock Shrimp Tempura and it would not take a total food snob to realize they are using regular small shrimp and passing them off as their Japanese cousin. The sushi itself was probably quasi-fresh the night before and the specialty rolls were nothing special at all.</p>

<p class="review_text description">The only thing they seemed quick to bring us was the check, which ran us $200 for two people. We are both huge foodies with generous wallets for good cuisine. But next time we want to people watch and eat sushi, we'll opt for Whole Foods take-out and the E Network over Geisha House any night.</p>

I had a quick dinner here with friends and I must say that their sushi is fresh and I do recommend this place.  This is also a god place to just go have drinks before heading out to a club.  I've done that a few times.</p>

Unfortunately customer service does not seem to be a priority or even a consideration at the Dolce Group restaurants. I hope people stop giving them business. . . I can't believe a popular restaurant like this has a BAD customer service.  Most of the male waiters were rude with BAD attitudes.  We were too scared to call our waiter because his bad attitude!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   DOLCE group should trained their waiters well or hire better waiters with good attitudes.  Their waiters make customers never want to go back there again.</p>

    <p class="review_text description">I have been to Geisha House several times and have never been dissapointed.  Yes, the service is sometimes slow but the food has always been amazing.  My favorite thing ever is the Hollywood Roll.  It is sooo good!  I have also tried the Cowboy Roll and Ocean Dragon Roll which were also both pretty good.  For non sushi eaters the Udon Noodles with Beef are excellent as well as the Rock Shrimp Tempura.  The atmosphere is loud yet upbeat and fun.  Great for dinner and drinks before a night out with friends. (Les Deux, Element, and LAX are all within walking distance).  The bar is awesome too!   </p>

    <p class="review_text description"> I went there the other weekend for my birthday and a friends birthday. We had made reservations but they kept taking us to different spots trying to seat us somewhere.  They sat 5 of us at a 4 person table, so there was one less set of chopsticks and napkin.  I asked them for another set, which I never got and ended up having to share chopsticks and napkin with my friend.  Not to mention, they came by to fill up our water and filled up 3 glasses put a splash of water in the 4th and left and never came back to fill it up or bring the 5th person any water.  I don't mind sharing food and cocktails with my friends, but having to share napkins, utensils, and our waters is a little ridiculous. The decor is really cool and I like the vibe, the food was amazing and they had some really unique drinks, that were also really great.  Unfortunately I would not go back, because of the people who work there.  Any time we needed something our waiter would treat us like we were an inconvenience, but all we were asking for were the things he had forgotten to bring us.   My friends had to ask a couple times to get a fork because they didn't know how to use chopsticks with their meat, after asking 3 times and waiting, everyone else was almost done with their meal by the time the got them.  2 of the girls ordered the same thing and everyones food came out together except one of the girls, which was odd.  The weirdest thing was, we ordered Saki and they only brought 4 Saki cups, so I asked our waiter for another and he twitched when i asked him, almost as if I had asked him to do something horrible, I looked to my friend to see if she saw it or if I was seeing things, and she gave me a weird look and said she saw that too.  Overall, great food, great decor, would never go back because the people who work there are incompetent and rude.</p>

    <p class="review_text description">So does anyone notice that the good reviews are from people who have only reviewed the restaurants in their own company... What does that tell you? They are trying to counter the horrific reviews which are extremely honest and here's another. I stupidly went back to Geisha a 3rd time, a month ago, just to see if it was as bad as my past experiences, and they didn't disappoint. Having  very good wine knowledge can come in handy sometimes especially when the condescending "sommelier" tries to "up sell".  There were 4 people in my party and this is how it started. I chose a lovely chardonnay which was $80/bottle. After a short while the patronizing so called sommelier came over to inform me they were out and they would give me a "better" bottle for the same price. I selected a nicer bottle and it was delivered. After finishing that bottle I asked the server to get another bottle at the same price. The patronizing so called sommelier said he couldn't. This is when I realized he was a magician. He had  miraculously found the original bottle i asked for.. WOW...and guess what happened after that.. He found another. Since we had a driver for the evening we managed to have four bottles of wine and 3 of them were the wine I had originally asked for.  The server was rude and obnoxious and didn't know the difference between Hamachi and Yellowtail, (nothing!!) The server went missing for 45 mins and again we had to wait...and wait...The manager/ so called sommelier was rude and too concerned about the 3 blondes sitting down behind us than my party (Total Bill $650). I have eaten at Ketchup, Geisha and tonight I am eating at Dolce. I will again write an honest review and if they were smart they would pass this review onto the management at Dolce.
<br />Again, the ambiance was more of the focus than the basics. FOOD and SERVICE!!!!! </p>

    <p class="review_text description">Geisha House is 'typical' glamour by overrated LA standards. Come to stargaze, get some ambiance, and sip decent drinks with 'decked-out' friends willing to go with the flow. The live DJ and Tokyo cityscape against neon lights make it a great amp for the post-show doldrums. The wait can be long unless you know or pay the staff, which is comprised mostly of socialite-esque, asian when available, ditzes. The BLACK COD is delicious, but the sushi  average vis-a-vis LA's other options. If you've got time, money, and are easy to please,  enjoy Geisha House's change of scenery for a late night weekday treat.</p>

The Alaskin King Crab Legs were incredible.  If you like Cod then you have to try their Black Cod (the sauce it comes with is finger licking goos)!  Can't wait to comeback next Friday night.</p>

I told the waiter that he was being rude--he denied it--and then told us again that we have five minutes to wrap it up... </p>

    <p class="review_text description">After very much looking forward to eating at Geisha House, I was more than let down! I was there for a birthday party in the private room. Several of our food orders were wrong and it took an unusually long time to get our re-made food. Then, as we were barely finishing eating the manager asked us to leave because there was another party in this room. We were not told of this "time issue" in advance...if we had we would have gone elsewhere as we don't like being rushed during a celebratory and very expensive meal!  The hostess showed the next party to our room, and someone from that party walked into our private room and very rudely told us to get out while in the middle of opening gifts!  When we tried to explain our concerns about this to the manager he brushed us off. I then emailed the general manager of Geisha House and Dolce Group to let them know of my awful experience as for sure they would be disgusted with our treatment and maybe do something to prevent this from happening to other nice people who want to have an enjoyable evening at their restaurant. I have yet to get a response! These people should be out of business since they clearly don't know how to run one!</p>

    <p class="review_text description">I took my friend there for her birthday. Wow were we disappointed. $80 later, all we had was tempura, 2 maine lobster (not sure where the lobster was) hand rolls, 2 cut rolls, and 2 glasses of tap water. First the hand rolls, they resembled a taquito, not exactly what other SUSHI places would consider a handroll. Geisha House should be embaressed to even call their hand rolls as such.  Next, the 2 cut rolls, they were FULL of imitation crab meat. One of the rolls had a pencil size piece of tuna, not exactly what I expected.  Overall, not a great place to eat SUSHI, maybe great for star gazing, I think that is included in the price. Then the smell of incense lingering in the air was just so inappropriate.  So I agree with all of you who gave this place one star, I should have listened. So if you are curious, let me break it to you, there are better sushi places out there. </p>

    <p class="review_text description">I'We arranged for a 20 person dinner party at Geisha House at 7:30 last night for my wife's birthday. The food was good and wait staff were very attentive. After serving us our desert our waiter informed me that there was another party waiting for the room and asked us to wrap things up. I thought this was a practical request and asked my wife to  speed up the opening some of her birthday gifts.
<br />
<br />In the meantime your hostess brought up the entire party that was waiting for the room, to the room, and one of their guest proceeded to come into the room and rudely tell us to leave. This incident ruined for the entire evening to what was a very enjoyable evening.
<br />
<br />At the end of the evening, the waiter mentioned that we were limited to a 2 hour dinner with our contract. I was completely unaware of this and the contract they had me sign never mentioned it. To make things worse, one of the guests in our party approached the manager and made him aware of the situation. The manager brushed him off and was totally unapologetic for creating this unpleasant incident. </p>

    <p class="review_text description">Basically every Japanese fusion restaurant carries the same menu, teppanyaki filet mignon, spicy tuna crispy rice .. etc.
<br />Geisha House's dishes are decent and if it's your first time trying Japanese fusion food, you would definitely like it. The crispy rice is a signature dish but all in all, there are better Asian fusion restaurants available and within the same price range , for example Koi restaurant.</p>

<p class="review_text description">The restaurant can get quite noisy since there's a bar scene other than the dining area. The decor is unique and it's worth checking out.</p>
